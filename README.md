## Features

- **Role-based views**: Operators and Carriers have distinct access to specific features via a dropdown menu in the app bar.
- **Operations Overview**: A homepage displaying several key WMS functions, such as Stock Transfer, Shipment Orders, Dispatch Orders, ASN, Consignments, and more.
- **Check-in Page**: Designed specifically for carriers to manage consignments, e-bills, e-way bills, and proof of delivery.
- **Responsive UI**: Grid-based UI with outlined buttons and font-awesome icons for intuitive navigation.

## Recent Updates

- **Dropdown Role Switching**: A dropdown in the app bar allows seamless switching between `Operator` and `Carrier` roles.
- **Consistent Design**: The `Check-in` page now follows the same grid-based design as the main operations homepage, with role-specific functionalities.
- **Back Button Removal**: The `Check-in` page no longer has a back button for better user navigation and focus.
